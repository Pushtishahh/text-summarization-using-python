# text-summarization-using-python
This Text summarization model is built using a sequence-to-sequence model that involves generating a concise and coherent summary of a given piece of text. This approach utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture, commonly built with recurrent neural network variants like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory).
